In this project I had to implement a player for the ConnectX game.\
The game is a generalized version of Connect 4, in this game we had a $M\times N$ table where the two players msut connect $X$ pieces in a row, column or on the diagonal in order to win the match.\
I had to implement a generic player that wins as many time as possible against another player.\
Player is: connectx.ABP.ABP
